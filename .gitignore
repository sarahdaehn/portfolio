# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*

# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data, such as

# control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject 
# to change depending on the environment.
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in

# !example_override.tf
